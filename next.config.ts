/**
 * Build configuration (#332).
 *
 * Three things that the build is expected to provide had been dropped from this
 * file and are restored here, because the rest of the repo still assumes them:
 *
 *   1. **Bundle analysis** — `npm run analyze` sets `ANALYZE=true` and the
 *      `@next/bundle-analyzer` devDependency is installed, but nothing consumed
 *      either, so the script was a no-op.
 *   2. **Initial-JS budget** — CI runs the production build with
 *      `ENFORCE_BUDGET=true` expecting a budget violation to fail the build.
 *      Without the webpack `performance` block that env var did nothing.
 *   3. **Security headers** — `src/lib/avatar.ts` documents that "the app's CSP
 *      allows img-src 'self' data:", and `src/__tests__/security-audit.ts`
 *      asserts the whole header set. Both were describing headers this config
 *      no longer sent.

/**
 * Initial JS budget for the client entrypoint, in bytes.
 *
 * 1100 KB is a **ratchet, not a target**: it is set just above what the largest
 * route (`/profile`, ~1000 KB) actually ships today, so the build fails when a
 * change makes things worse. The number this config previously carried was
 * 100 KB, which no route has met for a long time — with enforcement wired up
 * again, that value would fail every CI build regardless of the change under
 * test, which is why it is not restored as-is.
 *
 * Lower it as routes get smaller; the biggest single win available is the
 * ~700 KB `@stellar/stellar-sdk` pulled into every wallet-aware route.

// ratchet is deliberately still tight -- it catches a real regression, it just
// no longer fails on the pre-existing overage. Bringing the entrypoint back

// is the obvious lever) and lowering this number is its own piece of work.
